Astronomy Data - HR Diagram Dataset
Overview
This repository contains a dataset and code related to the construction of an Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram.
The HR diagram is a fundamental tool in astronomy used to classify stars based on their luminosity, temperature, and evolutionary stage.

Dataset
The dataset provided in this repository includes observational data of stars, capturing information such as:

Temperature(K)
Luminosity(L/Lo)
Radius(R/Ro)
Absolute magnitude(Mv)
Star type
Star color
Spectral Class
This data forms the basis for constructing the HR diagram, a graphical representation that helps astronomers understand the life cycle and characteristics of stars.
